# FOR-CSESOC-APPLICATION

<h2> Greeting, Recruiters and Project team.
  These are some tiny project that I practiced back in the days, which is pretty fundamental, but I think it's better to show some progress instead of leaving a blank there. </h2>
  
  Since these small projects was for practicing, so the lack of the cohesion might present in the code. As a result, I would demonstrate the code here. By the way, my main language is Python, following by C, HTML/CSS and also have some experiences in XML, JSON, SQL.
  
  1. Letter Frequency Test
  
  Language: Python
  
  Skills applied: Regular Expression, Dictionary, file import/read
  
  This is an idea that I randomly came across, which is checking the letter frequency by integrating the regular expression. The result in excel indicates the result is aligned with the data from Wikipedia.
  
  2. Web developement
  
  Language: HTML/CSS
  
  Skills applied: Interactive Design (for mobile and laptop), Psuedo-element, Pseudo-class
  
  This is a website that I designed and programmed alone during the summer, which was a pretty fun experience. However, the whole website is constructed from scratch without any external web developing tool so it might not seem as impressive as it should be. I enjoyed the process anyway.  
  
  3. Data Structure and Object Oriented Programming
  
  Language: Python
  
  Skills applied: Object Oriented Programming, Data Structure and Algorithms
  
  These are data structures created by using object orientied programming. Just for practicing data structures.
